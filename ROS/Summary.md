**_Short note on ROS topics in simple english_**

Node:

- A node is a program that performs some computation or communicates with other nodes. It can be written in any language, but it must be able to communicate with other nodes using ROS messages and services. Nodes can be grouped into packages, which are directories containing one or more nodes, along with other files and directories that are needed to build the nodes.

Topic:

- A topic is a named channel over which nodes can exchange messages. A topic is a channel of communication between nodes. Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages. A topic is a named channel over which nodes can exchange messages. A topic is a channel of communication between nodes. Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.

Message:

- A message is a ROS data type used when publishing or subscribing to a topic. A message is a ROS data type used when publishing or subscribing to a topic.

Service:

- A service is a named channel over which nodes can exchange requests and replies. A service is a named channel over which nodes can exchange requests and replies. It is similar to a topic, except that a service is request/response rather than publish/subscribe. The main difference between request/response and publish/subscribe is that in request/response, the sender of the message expects a response from the receiver, while in publish/subscribe, the sender does not expect a response from the receiver.

Parameter:

- A parameter is a named value used to configure a node. A parameter is a named value used to configure a node.

Master:

- The master is a node that manages all other nodes in the system. It keeps track of all publishers and subscribers to topics as well as all services that are available. It also provides a naming and registration service so that nodes can find each other in the network.

Package:

- A package is a directory containing all the files that make up an application.
